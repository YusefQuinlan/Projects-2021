The mini projects that you see here are called mini projects as they are fun and small programs that I have made in generally
30 minutes - 1 hour. Not much time has gone into them and they serve as fun experiments more than anything. Below I will detail what they do,
in order of their creation date.

Breaks - Created (13/03/2021) 
_____________________________
The Breaks.py file simply uses a Tkinter interface to ask a user for when they want to take a break from their work (on start-up the program assumes,
that the user wanted to take a break at some point), the time is in minutes, once the time is up, a small audio files will play that alerts the user
that it is time for them to take a break, it is rather loud and obnoxious, in order that it forces the user to listen. After this audio finishes,
the user will be shown a messagebox informing them that it is time to take a break, and that once the break is over that they should press the 'OK' button 
of the messagebox. Upon pressing 'OK' an alertbox will be displayed asking the user if they'd like to schedule another break, if so then the program repeats
itself, otherwise the program ends.
