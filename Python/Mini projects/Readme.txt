The mini projects that you see here are called mini projects as they are fun and small programs that I have made in generally
30 minutes - 1 hour. Not much time has gone into them and they serve as fun experiments more than anything. Below I will detail what they do,
in order of their creation date.

Breaks - Created (13/03/2021) 
_____________________________
The Breaks.py file simply uses a Tkinter interface to ask a user for when they want to take a break from their work (on start-up the program assumes,
that the user wanted to take a break at some point), the time is in minutes, once the time is up, a small audio files will play that alerts the user
that it is time for them to take a break, it is rather loud and obnoxious, in order that it forces the user to listen. After this audio finishes,
the user will be shown a messagebox informing them that it is time to take a break, and that once the break is over that they should press the 'OK' button 
of the messagebox. Upon pressing 'OK' an alertbox will be displayed asking the user if they'd like to schedule another break, if so then the program repeats
itself, otherwise the program ends.

Google Trends Analysis - Created (18/03/2021)
________________________________________________
The TrendsAnalysis.py file creates several matplotlib plots from data gathered from a csv file containing google trends information, found at https://www.kaggle.com/dhruvildave/google-trends-dataset
The csv file can also be found in the Analysis folder. The program itself just follows the most popular queries in 2001 to see if they stay relevant over
time and how relevant they stay. Thats what the plots show. The plots pretty much show that the queries in general fail to stay relevant over time, suggesting
that trends change over time, in my opinion anyway, this whole problem and program was made/solved in about an hour, so the analysis is not that thorough.

Public-Api-Fun   - Created (20/03/2021)
__________________________________________
The ApiFun.py file is an interface to three different API's, the API's are all public so no API Key is needed. The interface describes each API
and offers a button to allow users to open a new window that lets them interact with the API. The API's so far allow users to input a number and
a random fact about that number will be output for the user to see, one generates Chuck Norris jokes, and the final one allows users
to search for a pokemon and the id of that pokemon will be output for the user to see. These API's aren't very useful, this was just a bit of fun in my
spare time.

Self-Print-Image   - Created(21/03/2021)
_________________________________________
The Self-Print-Image.py file is simply a program that reads itself to get its own text, prints out its text, and then creates an image that
is then overlayed with the text contained within the program. This image is then saved in the directory in which this python program is run.
The program itself is very simple and not that interesting, however for some reason I found the concept really interesting and am currently considering
getting this image put on a tshirt and wearing that tshirt around. This has also given me an idea for a larger project.
