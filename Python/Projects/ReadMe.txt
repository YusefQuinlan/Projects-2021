The  projects that you see here are called are more serious programs that I have made in generally
4 - 20 hours. Below I will detail what they do,in order of their creation date, note that as they get updated they will do more as 
not all work is completed in one coding session.

Covid-Data-Analysis-Interface   -    Created (19/03/2021)
___________________________________________________________
At the moment this just imports a csv file found at : https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv , the csv file contains all kinds of
data about Covid-19. I made some charts and did some analysis on this dataset before, but now want to do more analysis and also make an interface for 
this data. The interface should allow users to choose what countries/regions they want to analyse and once they click into a region, what kind of data
analysis they want done. I am not sure at this point exactly what analysis I want to do, or what visualisations should be output. It is a work in progress
at the moment.
